    "# Time Series Analysis with Pandas Cont.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hydrology and other Earth and environmental sciences, we're often interested in statistical outliers in our time series data. These often represent extreme values like floods and droughts for which we either need to be designing infrastructure (like bridges and culverts) around or developing management strategies to guard against. Below we explore some of the helpful tools that `Pandas` offers to perform time series analysis. One example involves estimating the 100-year flood in the Boise River, while the other example involves estimating a low-flow metric called the 7Q10 in the Boise River. \n",

    "There are a number of ways to estimate the 100-year flood, but by definition it is the maximum annual daily flow that is equaled or exceeded (on average) no more than once every 100 years. We will use a relatively straightforward, non-parametric method called the Weibull plotting position formula. The Weibull plotting method involves assigning a non-exceedance probability to every annual maximum flow, based on its rank order. The Weibull probability for each annual maximum flow is calculated as:\n",
