    "### 1. Problem Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "As a new graduate student, your research is examining the performance of 5-day precipitation forecasts at a number of Snotel sites in the Upper Boise River Basin. The forecasts are generated by a research center at a university in the western United States using the [Weather Research and Forecasting](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/) model. They run a 360 hr (i.e., 15 day) forecast using WRF every day at the top of every hour for the entire western United States, and puts the output you need on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket that is freely available.  \n",
    "\n",
    "File pattern:\n",
    "WRF_fcst_YYYYMMDD_HHz_VVV.nc\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- YYYY is the year of the forecast date\n",
    "- MM is the month of the forecast date\n",
    "- DD is the day of the forecast\n",
    "- HH is the hour the forecast was initiated (0-23)\n",
    "- VVV is the valid hour of the forecast from the time of initiation in hours (0-360 hr in 3 hr increments). So 000 is the initial hour of the forecast, 003 would be the 3rd hour, 006 the 6th, and so forth.\n",
    "- 'WRF_fcst_' is the prefix of the file name\n",
    "- '.nc' is the file extension (this stands for NetCDF file - a real file format)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Instructions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes as input the forecast year, month, day, and hour, as well as a maximum valid hour and returns a list of file names that contain the forecast data\n",
    "2. Test your code for three consecutive days (2025-03-01, 2025-03-02, and 2025-03-03), for forecast hour 6, and a maximum valid hour of 120 hours. Print the results of the returned list to the screen and verify manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Concepts Assessed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- String handling\n",
    "- For loops\n",
    "- Basic functions"
